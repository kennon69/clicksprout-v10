# Custom Logo Directory

Place your custom logo file in this directory to replace the default ClickSprout logo.

## Supported File
- **File name**: `logo.png`
- **Recommended size**: 32x32px to 256x256px
- **Format**: PNG (preferred for transparency)
- **Aspect ratio**: 1:1 (square) recommended

## Usage
1. Save your logo as `logo.png` in this directory
2. The logo will automatically appear in:
   - Sidebar navigation
   - Header (mobile view)
   - Any other components that reference the logo

## Fallback
If `logo.png` is not found or fails to load, the system will automatically fall back to the default gradient "C" logo.

## Tips
- Use a transparent background for best results
- Ensure good contrast for both light and dark modes
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
